[ ] data fixes from reviews???
  - sec 4.8 perhaps, 

MUST contain 3 parts

---

1. a Markdown-formatted README.md of your artifact,
2. a URL pointing to either
   - a single file containing the artifact (recommended)
   - or the address of a public source control repository,
3. a hash certifying the version of the artifact at submission time, either an
   sha256 hash of the single file (use the sha256sum command-line tool to
   generate the hash) or the full commit hash for the repository (e.g., from
   git reflog --no-abbrev)

The URL must be a public Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab
URL, to help protect the anonymity of the reviewers.
Artifacts do not need to be anonymous; reviewers will be aware of author identities.

public github: https://github.com/bennn/luau-telemetry
has paper and ... no data!

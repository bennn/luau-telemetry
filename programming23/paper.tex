  \paragraph{Context}
  %% What is the broad context of the work? What is
  %% the importance of the general research area?
  {Roblox Studio} lets millions of creators
  build interactive experiences by programming in a variant
  of Lua called Luau.
  The creators form a broad group, ranging from novices writing
  their first script to professional developers, thus Luau
  must support a wide audience.
  As part of its efforts to support all kinds programmers, Luau includes an
  optional, gradual type system and goes to great lengths to minimize false
  positive errors.

  \paragraph{Inquiry}
  %% What problem or question does the paper
  %% address? How has this problem or question been
  %% addressed by others (if at all)?
  Since Luau is currently being used by many creators, we want to collect their feedback
  to improve the language and, in particular, the type system.
  The standard way to collect feedback at a large scale from creators working on
  realistic projects is to deploy client-side telemetry; however, we must do
  so in a way that respects creators' privacy.
  Whatever telemetry we use to study the Luau language cannot include
  personally-identifiable information.
  For example, we cannot monitor source code or error messages as they
  may contain personal data.
  Finding ways to harness telemetry in a private way is the central research challenge.
  %% TODO awkward

  \paragraph{Approach}
  %% What was done that unveiled new knowledge?
  We designed and implemented a pseudonymized telemetry system for Luau.
  Telemetry records include a timestamp, a session id, a reason for sending,
  and a numeric summary of the most recent type analysis.
  This information lets us follow type analysis over time within a codebase
  without revealing private information.
  Over four months in Spring 2023, we deployed the telemetry system and collected
  1.5 million telemetry records.

  \paragraph{Knowledge}
  %% What new facts were uncovered? If the
  %% research was not results oriented, what new
  %% capabilities are enabled by the work?
  We present several findings about Luau.
  Some confirm hypotheses by the Luau team while others are rather surprising,
  but all findings support our claim that pseudonymized telemetry is a
  useful way to collect feedback.
  One of the less-surprising findings is that types are unpopular:
  there is an 100x gap between the number of untyped Luau sessions and the number
  of typed ones.
  One surprise is that the strict mode for type analysis is very conservative
  about interactions with data assets.
  Instead of using the flexible dynamic type, it uses a top type and requires
  creators to down-cast assets.
  Lastly, a reassuring finding is that type analysis rarely hits its internal
  limits on problem size.

  \paragraph{Grounding}
  %% What argument, feasibility proof, artifacts,
  %% or results and evaluation support this work?
  Our findings are supported by a publicly-available dataset
  of over 1.5 million telemetry records
  and by free software for analyzing the data.

  \paragraph{Importance}
  %% Why does this work matter?
  Luau is the first large-scale combination of gradual types and semantic
  subtyping.
  Beyond the immediate benefits to Luau,
  our findings about types and type errors have implications
  for adoption and ergonomics in other gradual languages.
  %% mention Elixir, Verse?
  FILL specifics.
  Our telemetry design is of broad interest, as it gathers useful
  data without exposing personal information.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:introduction}

{Roblox} is a platform for {shared virtual experiences}, with
65~million Daily Active Users, and 14~billion hours of engagement in
April--June 2023.
There are over 5~million experiences available on the platform thanks to a
worldwide community of 3~million creators~\cite{corp.roblox.com}.

Creators build experiences using the
{Luau} programming language~\cite{luau-lang.org},
an extension of {Lua~5.1~\cite{lua}}.
The main addition in Luau is a static type system, which infers
types for all Luau programs on the fly, as creators modify the code.
These types are used primarily in type-driven tooling such as autocomplete and
API documentation~\cite{luau-autocomplete}; the typical creator is unaware
that a type system powers these tools.
However, creators may write their own types, and they can opt in
to receiving ype error reports.

As discussed in~\cite{bfj-hatra-2021},
the goals of the {Luau} type system are rather different from
a traditional type system, which focuses on compilation and memory safety.
{Luau} has a diverse user community, ranging from
students in code camps to professional development studios. These
creators have quite different needs, with different emphases on
enabling rapid creation and ensuring software quality.
{Luau} therefore supports three typing modes for user code:
the hands-off default \mnocheck{},
a relaxed \mnonstrict{} mode,
and a rigorous \mstrict{} mode.
Creators can switch between modes
gradually~\cite{st-sfp-2006,tfffgksst-snapl-2017}, one module at a time.

In this paper, we investigate methods for measuring the effectiveness
of the {Luau} type system in the development of {Roblox} scripts.
We want to collect measurements at a large scale, with thousands
of participants, and we must do so in a way that protects creators' privacy.
In comparison to prior work~(\cref{s:related}), which
with few exceptions~\cite{zhlbr-cc-2020,zhlbr-oopsla-2020,hlzbr-ecoop-2021} is either small in scale
or collects personally identifiable information~(PII),
we performed a large-scale study using \panon{} \emph{telemetry}.

{Roblox Studio} has a telemetry system, which is used to gauge
the effectiveness of creation features. This system randomly
determines which sessions should report telemetry, and for those
sessions, reports telemetry records back with a summary of the
session. In the case of this study, the telemetry includes data on the
number of errors at various levels of granularity: in the current edit
range, in the current file, and in every file which was type
checked.

The telemetry data we analyzed does not contain any PII.
It has no source code;
 no source locations;
no error messages (which may contain source code);
no error messages;
no record of the creator's identity, locale, or IP address;
and no information about what creation the data came from.
Telemetry records are correlated by session, using a \panon{}
session identifier.

Most users of {Roblox Studio} do not opt in to type error
reporting (\pct{90},~\cref{s:data}), and so they do not see the ``squiggly underlining'' that
indicates a type error site. Nonetheless, the type inference system
still runs in the background (since it drives autocomplete and other
type-based tools), letting us see which type errors would have
been reported and whether users fix these errors over time.

With this telemetry data, we investigate research questions about
the adoption and benefits of type analysis:
\begin{description}
  \item[RQ1.]
    How many creators use type analysis?
    How often do projects contain modules with different
    analysis modes?
    How often do creators turn analysis off?
  \item[RQ2.]
    For modules that use type analysis:
    which errors arise,
    how do creators respond,
    and which errors tend to persist despite subsequent edits?
  \item[RQ3.]
    What impact does type analysis have on the number of background type
    errors?
    For example, do background errors pile up in unanalyzed projects?
\end{description}

Beyond their immediate applications to {Luau},
answers to these questions have implications for the design
of gradual types~\cite{st-sfp-2006}, success types~\cite{lindahl2006practical},
and semantic subtyping~\cite{CF05:GentleIntroduction,Jef22:SemanticSubtyping}.
Luau represents the first large-scale combination of these features,
and lessons from this experience can inform future applications.

At a higher level, this paper is the first to use telemetry 
to study a typechecker.
It thus represents a step toward data-driven language design,
informed by many users' actual practice.
Our data captures over 340,000 sessions
that occured between February and April 2023
and includes 72 million type analysis errors.
By contrast to typical qualitative methods such as surveys and interviews, it
is not restricted to users' \emph{perceptions} about their work and it is not
limited to a small number of users.

FILL can stats answer questions that point-by-point analysis cannot?

\paragraph{Contributions}

  \item

  \caption{{Roblox Studio 3D creation} tools (left) and IDE (right).}
  \label{fig:roblox-studio}
\end{figure}

%% \FILL{} explain the name "creators"?

{Roblox Studio} is a workbench that
combines {3D creation} tools and an Integrated
Developer Environment (IDE), as seen in \Cref{fig:roblox-studio}.
The IDE includes an optional \emph{Script Analysis} widget that
reports syntax errors, type errors, and problems identified by
lint tools. The script editor also (optionally) highlights
the location in code where reported errors occur.
Creators have three \emph{analysis modes} (modes) to choose from
for every script they write:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \mnocheck{}: report only syntax errors,
  \item \mnonstrict{}: report syntax errors and a subset of ``high confidence'' type errors, or
  \item \mstrict{}: report syntax errors and all type errors.
\end{itemize}
Each run of type analysis can report several errors.
There is no guarantee that creators read every error.
In fact, creators who close the Script Analysis widget
will see highlights in their code but no further details.

As an example of nonstrict mode, the following program only reports one error:
\begin{verbatim}
  --!nonstrict
  local x = { p = 5, q = nil }
  if condition then x.q = 7 end
  local y = x.p + x.q --> no type error
  local z = x.r       --> "Key 'r' not found in table 'x'"
\end{verbatim}
but in strict mode it reports two:
\begin{verbatim}
  --!strict
  local x = { p = 5, q = nil }
  if condition then x.q = 7 end
  local y = x.p + x.q --> "Type 'nil' could not be converted into 'number'"
  local z = x.r       --> "Key 'r' not found in table 'x'"
\end{verbatim}
In cases like this, where it is undecidable whether there will be a run-time error,
strict mode errs on the side of reporting an error, and nonstrict mode errs on
the side of suppressing the error.

Both modes report the \verb|Key 'r' not found in table 'x'| error --
misspellings of property names are common enough to report in both
strict and nonstrict mode. See~\cite{bfj-hatra-2021}
for a more detailed discussion of the rationale for strict and nonstrict mode.

Both modes are opt-in. The default for a new script is \mnocheck{} by
default, but creators can change this default to \mnonstrict{}.

Even in \mnocheck{} mode, {Roblox Studio} performs type inference, since
the results are needed by type-directed tooling such as autocomplete and
API documentation. This behind-the-scenes typechecking is always performed
in strict mode, since it is important that the inferred types be as precise
as possible. The type errors produced by this pass are always discarded,
so the verbosity of strict mode is not an issue.

Since this pass is always performed in strict mode, we refer to it as
\emph{forced strict} mode. Its main use is in autocomplete, so forced
strict mode is triggered on every keystroke

Scripts come in two favors: \emph{module scripts} and \emph{non-module
scripts}.  Module scripts provide reusable libraries, which may be
\emph{required} by other scripts. Since module scripts can require
other module script, modules form a graph (though it is
an error in strict mode if the graph is cyclic, and edges are removed to
make the graph acyclic).

When typechecking is performed for script analysis, any script that
has been modified is marked as dirty, then any script that is dirty,
or which transitively requires a dirty module, is typechecked. More
commonly, when typechecking is performed for autocomplete, only
the current script is typechecked, since it is the only dirty
script, and nothing it requires can transitively require it, since
the module graph is acyclic.

The state of the world in a {Roblox} experience is captured by
the \emph{data model}, which is a tree of \emph{instances}, such as
parts, models, meshes, effects, lighting, audio assets, and physics
constraints such as forces, springs and joints.
%% The data model can be seen in the Explorer view of~\Cref{fig:roblox-studio}.
%% ben: where is it? very hard to see
While an experience is under development, it is typical for the data
model to be edited (for example instances to be added, deleted, moved
or renamed). Since the initial shape of the data model tree is reflected in
the type system, it is possible for these edits to introduce type errors.

\section{Telemetry Design}

\subsection{Limits of telemetry}

Telemetry allows an application to ``phone home'' with data
summarizing usage patterns, such performance data, crash reporting,
and feature uptake. A typical usage is in deciding whether an API can
be deprecated: without telemetry it may be difficult to know how
popular a feature is with users, but with telemetry it is
straightforward.

IDEs use telemetry in a similar fashion to most user-facing
applications, for example VSCode~\cite{vsc-telemetry} and
IntelliJ~\cite{intellij-telemetry} report telemetry.
See~\cref{s:related} for futher comparisons among telemetry designs.

Telemetry for programming languages can be controversial, for example
the lively discussion around telemetry in the Go
toolchain~\cite{golang-telemetry}. 
The Luau open source toolchain does \emph{not} report telemetry,
as it is designed to be used in build environments such as Continuous Integration
servers, where hermetic deterministic builds are expected.

Much of the concern about telemetry is because of its potential impact on
privacy, by revealing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
For this reason, it is important that any experiments using telemetry
not reveal PII:
no source code;
no source code locations;
no error messages (which may contain source code);
no record of the creator's identity, locale, or IP address;
and no information about what creation the data came from.
A good introduction to the privacy implications and tradeoffs
involved with telemetry is~\cite{transparent-telemetry}.

For performance reasons, there are limits to telemetry data:
telemetry records have size limits, and the performance impact of
recording telemetry should be minimal.

In summary, the limitations of telemetry are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data which reveals no PII.
  \item Fixed-size telemetry records.
  \item Minimal overhead to record telemtry.
\end{itemize}
In addition, due to the architecture of Roblox Studio
there is some information that is not available to the
typechecker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The typechecker does not have access to some lifecycle events,
    such as save, quit and publish.
  \item The typechecker does not have access to GUI state, for example
    whether the Script Analysis widget is visible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Telemetry Records}
\label{s:telemetry-records}

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}\hline
    ID & Time & Mode & Reason & Size Info & Overall Counts & Edit Range Counts
    \\\toprule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Structure of a telemetry record. There are 13 overall counts and up to 70 edit range counts in each record.}
  \label{f:tdata}
\end{figure}

The telemetry for a Roblox Studio session is gathered as a series of
telemtry records, all with the same \panon{} session
identifier. This allows us to correlate telemetry across a single
session, but not between sessions.

In order to avoid swamping our telemetry servers, we randomly throttle
the generation of telemetry records:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    1\% of Roblox Studio sessions were enrolled in generating telemetry, and
  \item
    0.5\% of runs of the typechecker (approximately 1 in 200 keystrokes)
      in an enrolled session generated a telemetry record.
\end{itemize}
In order to find how file-switching correlated with type errors, we additionally have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    every run of the typechecker in an enrolled session which switched file generated a telemetry record.
\end{itemize}

To track the edit range, we record a start and end position, which we
update appropriately on every edit. This can result in very large edit
ranges, for example, if the user edits at the beginning and end of the
file.
The main benefit of this strategy is that it ensures constant-size telemetry records.

Each telemetry record contains seven kinds of data.
Refer to~\cref{f:tdata} for an illustration:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    ID: a \panon{} identifier for the current session
  \item
    Time: one timestamp from the client and one from the server.
    %% timestamp explanation \cref{s:data-cleaning}
  \item
    Mode: type analysis mode of the current file, which is either \mnocheck{},
    \mnonstrict{}, or \mstrict{}.
  \item
    Reason: a flag that explains whether this record was sent due to a
    randomly-selected keystroke or a module switch.
  \item
    Size Info: number of lines in the codebase and number of lines in the edit range.
  \item
    Overall Counts: summarizes type errors and forced strict errors during the
    last two invocations of type analysis, and additionally reports the number
    of times type analysis hit an internal limit on problem
    size~(see~\cref{s:code-too-complex} for details).
    For each invocation and each kind of
    analysis error, there are three summary counts:
    %% grand total = 12
    \begin{itemize}
      \item total number of errors,
      \item errors in the current module, and
      \item errors in the current edit range.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Edit Range Counts: these list specific errors that arose in the last two
    type analyses and overlap with the current edit range.
    Since there are 35 possible errors~(\cref{s:context}), there can be up to 70 counts
    in a telemetry record.
    Exactly how to interpret this data depends on which analysis it came from:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        Errors in the latest type analysis are currently visible to the
        creator.
        These may have been introduced by the changes in the edit range.
      \item
        Errors from the previous type analysis were visible before the creator
        made the latest edits.
        These may have motivated some of the changes in the edit range.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Reflections}
This kind of telemetry data is coarse-grained.
For instance, it does not let us distinguish between edits that ignore a type
error from edits that remove one error while introducing another.
We acknowledge this and other threats in~\cref{s:threats}.
The main advantages of the telemetry design are the small size of each record
and complete the lack of PII.
Furthermore, despite the limitations, Studio's telemetry supports a variety of
interesting conclusions that we showcase in the next section.


\section{The Data}
\label{s:data}

Roblox Studio collected type error telemetry in Spring 2023,
between February and April.
Every Studio session had a small random chance of generating
telemetry~(\cref{s:telemetry-records}).
The chosen sessions generated a record whenever the user switched modules and
randomly on each keystroke.
In total, we collected 1.5 million telemetry records.
Roughly two-thirds of records are due to keystrokes.

\Cref{f:records-per-hour} provides a time-ordered distribution of the data.
Each vertical bar counts the number of records generated per hour according to
a client-side timestamp.\todo{Do we need all this detail?}
The bars are labeled with a California time zone because that is the locale of
the Roblox servers, which parsed the timestamps.
Most buckets contain roughly one thousand records, but some have very few
and a handful of others exceed three thousand.
%% \FILL{} investigate one tower, what's happening?? all one session?
There is a sharp drop in early April when the experiment was finished
and the telemetry probe was removed (though there is a long tail as
developers uopdated Roblox Studio).
We do not know which timezone the records originated in, but since the counts
tend to peak midday California time it seems that the majority
of Roblox developers are following a Western Hemisphere schedule.
The counts for weekends (shaded regions) are often the tallest,
as Roblox has a significant school-aged creator community.

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
\label{s:data-cleaning}

A close inspection of the data revealed a few anomalies.
For the most part, we omit the strange data from futher
analysis.\todo{I'm inclined to rewrite this to be much more concise.}

First, some records have odd timestamps according to the server's records.
Every telemetry record comes with two timestamps: a client-side timestamp
from when Roblox Studio created it and a server-side timestamp from when
the server posted it to its database.
The server timestamps are little use for our analysis because they bunch
together; it is common for several records to have identical server
timestamps.
However, server timestamps are useful for auditing because they should
be relatively close in value to the client timestamps.
For a small number of records (<100? \FILL{}), though, the client is off by a large
margin: up to one week behind and up to one day ahead of the server.
We attribute the large delays to issues when sending telemetry (lost internet
connection, etc.) and smaller offsets to incorrect time settings on the client
machine.
In any event, we do not filter these records from further
analysis.\todo{To be clear, you do NOT filter? Because the section is
  about what you DO filter.}

Second, some records have identical (client) timestamps.
This can happen legitimately if type analysis runs several times
in the same millisecond, but it is unlikely that a human would
enter keystrokes or switch modules quickly enough.
We keep the first record with a distinct timestamp and discard the others.
%% TODO wait, better deduplicate by session and not globally!!!

%% out/negative-edit-range.txt
%% actual value is NOT negative, but large positive over 4 billion
%% example: 4294967293
Third, the edit ranges are negative in a few hundred records~(1,533).
This is likely due to the user deleting a large block of code.
Since the issue affects so few records, we omit the negative ranges
from analysis (but, we do use other parts of the records; for example
the timestamps influence~\cref{f:records-per-hour}).

\subsection{Overall Size and Shape}

Three important characteristics of the recorded data are the size of the codebases,
the length of the sessions, and the number of type
errors.
We discuss these in turn.
Codebase size and session length follow power-law
distributions,\todo{Please confirm w/ a statistical test. See Clauset
  et al.: arXiv:0706.1062.} with
many small items and a few very large items.
The number of type analysis errors is somewhat low~(explained in the next
section), but sufficient to proceed with futher analysis.

  \label{f:codebase-size}
\end{figure}

\Cref{f:codebase-size} summarizes the size of projects in the dataset.
The top half of the figure reports the mean, standard deviation, median,
and \percentile{99} for the number of lines
and lines in edit range.\footnote{The data also contains the number of files in
each project, but these numbers are difficult to relate to typechecking because
projects may contain hundreds of files that define data assets.  For the
record, the median file count is 7,678 and the 99th percentile is 51,761 files.
}
The bottom half shows zoomed-in distributions of the line and edit range
sizes.
For example, the x-axis of the first plot ranges from 0 to 1,000 lines and
the y-axis counts up to 1,000 telemetry records.

There is a huge amount of variation across projects.
The largest ones have over 50,000 lines of code
while the smallest have merely 1 line of code.
Unsurprisingly, the numbers come with large standard
deviations~([std] in~\cref{f:codebase-size}).
The median values are more reasonable, with roughly 3,000 lines of code
and 1,000 lines in edit ranges.

  \end{tabular}

  \caption{Session size in seconds and in number of records.}
  \label{f:session-size}
\end{figure}

\Cref{f:session-size} outlines the size of the Roblox Studio sessions in the
data.
There are two useful notions of size: real time in seconds (between the first
and last record) and the total number of records.
The top of~\cref{f:session-size} reports the mean, standard deviation,
median, and \percentile{99}; the bottom shows size distributions, zoomed in
to focus on at most 1,000 units (x-axis) and 1,000 sessions
(y-axis).\todo{Again, confused.}

Similar to the data on project size, there is huge variation in session
length.
The longest sessions last several days and/or contain thousands of records,
while the shortest last a few milliseconds or include just one record.
Likewise, both plots in the figure follow a power-law distribution
(especially for record count).
A typical session runs on the order of minutes and consists of a few dozen events.
The median session time is approximately 14 minutes.
The median number of
records is 138.
% These numbers are reasonable.

  \caption{Type errors and forced strict errors across all telemetry records.}
  \label{f:count-analysis-errors}
\end{figure}

\FILL{} need old and current in edit range

\Cref{f:count-analysis-errors} lists the number of type analysis errors
and breaks them down by location in the codebase.
In total, there are nearly 600K type errors.
These appeared in modules that opted in to typechecking with either the
\mnonstrict{} or \mstrict{} mode.
The number of forced strict errors is much larger, 72M, because this analysis
ran on every module using strict type.
(Furthermore, forced strict runs silently, so creators have no
awareness of or incentive to
fix these errors.)
Approximately half the analysis errors occurred in the current module,
and a small fraction overlapped with the current edit range~(\pct{5} for
type errors, \pct{1} for forced strict).

The large fraction of errors in the current module is encouraging.
It suggests that errors appear locally, as the result of edits to nearby
code (as opposed to edits in one module raising errors in another), and
that creators fix the errors before switching focus to another
module.
The low fraction of errors in the edit range suggests that errors rarely
persist through nearby edits.

  \caption{Overview of type analysis modes.}
  \label{f:dataset-overview}
\end{figure}

Creators have three analysis modes to choose from.
Furthermore, they can switch between modes at any time.
According to~\cref{s:type-analysis-modes}, however, usage is
extremely skewed toward the type-free \mnocheck{} mode.
Nearly \pct{90} of all records use the \mnocheck{} mode
and \pct{90} of all sessions use \mnocheck{} exclusively.
Among the rest, roughly \pct{10} of all records use \mnonstrict{} and only a
tiny fraction (\pct{0.4}) use \mstrict{}.
The per-session data is similar: \pct{9} use \mnonstrict{} exclusively
and \pct{0.2} use \mstrict{}.

These adoption numbers indicate that there is a communication gap;
as long as type checking is opt-in, most developers stay opted out.
Once Luau type checking is opt-out rather than opt-in, it will be interesting
to revisit these numbers.

%% mostly pure, rare mixes
Most sessions (\pct{99.82}) stick to a single analysis mode.
These sessions never change the mode in the current module and never switch
focus to a module with a different analysis mode.
Among the mixed-mode sessions, most (\pct{80}) switch to modules with
a different mode, about half contain at least one edit that upgrades
the typing strictness in the
current mode, and about half contain a downgrade.
There are 619 upgrades in total and 583 downgrades.
\FILL{} Ben check how often the downgrades follow the upgrades.


\paragraph{Are Upgrades Discouraging?}

%% 619 up-pairs, 583 down-pairs
%% === UP
%% min -3 max 57 median 0 mean 2.62 stddev 6.8390518952707335
%% === DOWN
%% min -48 max 30 median 0 mean -0.31 stddev 4.498748355271854

A possible explanation for the low adoption of \mnonstrict{} and
\mstrict{} mode is that upgrading to these modes leads to a large
number of type errors.
Creators might get discouraged or overwhelmed by a high error count and revert to
\mnocheck{} mode.

The data does not support this explanation.
On average, the mode-upgrades in the data resulted in 3 additional
type errors (stddev 7, median 0).
The worst-case increase was 57 type errors, which is very high
but exceptional.
In another exception, upgrading modes removed three type errors
(possibly due to other edits being rolled in with the
mode change).

Similarly, mode downgrades have only a small negative effect on the
number of errors (mean -0.3, stddev 4, median 0, max -48).
%% curious outlier: downgrade added 30 errors!
Creators apparently tend switch modes only when the code is already
well typed, or close to it.\todo{What incentive is there to do so?}

  \label{f:error-by-mode}
\end{figure}

\Cref{f:error-by-mode} shows how the type errors and forced strict errors
in the data are split across type analysis modes.
\FILL{} add averages.

Most type errors come from \mnonstrict{} mode, despite it having an order
of magnitude fewer users that \mnocheck{}.
This is unsurprising because \mnocheck{} reports only syntax errors,
whereas \mnonstrict{} reports several others kinds~(detailed in the next section).
Finally, \mstrict{} mode accounts for a small fraction of type errors, despite
being more picky, because so few creators use it.

Forced strict analysis applies the same typechecker to every module, regardless
of mode, in the hope of enabling IDE tools.
Consequently, the breakdown of forced strict errors matches the overall usage
data~(\cref{f:dataset-overview}): almost \pct{90} for \mnocheck{},
\pct{10} for \mnonstrict{}, and \pct{1} for \mstrict{}.
Type analysis finds a large number of errors in \mnocheck{} code;
unfortunately, we have no insight into whether those errors are true
positives or whether the analysis led to useful IDE suggestions.

Equipped with an overall picture of the dataset and the skewed usage
of \mnocheck{}, \mnonstrict{}, and \mstrict{} modes, we are ready to explore
the type error data.
Our main focus is on the intersection between type errors
and edits to the programs.\todo{The next two sentences are in some
  sense our main RQs, right? I would call them out more explicitly and
  w/ more justification.}
When a type error highlights part of the code and the next edit range includes
that code, we want to know whether the error survives the edit.
Similarly, we want to know when an edit introduces a type error.

\Cref{t:type-error-survival} counts the number of times that types
errors overlap with the current edit range.
There are three sets of columns, corresponding to the \mnocheck{},
\mnonstrict{}, and \mstrict{} type analysis modes.
Within each set, the Add columns counts the number of telemetry records
that introduce a certain type error.
For example, seventeen of the \mnonstrict{} records add
at least one \code{CannotCallNonFunction} error to the current edit range.
The Keep columns counts records that have the same, non-zero number of type errors
before and after.
Lastly, the Remove columns count records that decrease the number of type errors.

All three counts are imprecise because our telemetry does not track the exact
identity of a type error.
Suppose a creator removes one \code{CannotCallNonFunction} error but then
immediately introduces another on a different line.
\Cref{t:type-error-survival} reports this pair of edits as a Keep rather than
an Add and a Remove because we cannot distinguish two errors of the same kind.


\paragraph{Observations}

%% \paragraph{Most Type Errors are Typos}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    One striking aspect of~\cref{t:type-error-survival} is the large number
    of \code{SyntaxError}s and the related errors \code{UnknownSymbol} and
    \code{UnknownProperty}.
    Most type errors in the data are likely due to typos.
    \Cref{s:type-error-count} discusses this point in detail.
    For now, we remark that \code{SyntaxError} is the only possible error
    in \mnocheck{} mode (by design) and observe that these errors are
    usually in the Drop column and seldom in the Keep column.\todo{So?}

  \item
    The numbers are relatively low in general, which means that
    few errors in the dataset overlap with the edit range
    The highest value in the \mstrict{} columns is 71, meaning 71 records
    out of 6,505 total~(\cref{f:dataset-overview} drop a syntax error.
    The \mnonstrict{} and \mnocheck{} columns are similar.
    %% FILL show percentages for all three modes?
    \FILL{} what does this mean? Not sure if bad, or inconclusive.

  \item
    %% Drop >= Add >= Rem ~= 27 triples
    %% other nonzero      ~= 13 triples
    When type errors overlap with the edit range,
    we would hope the number of Adds and Drops is roughly
    equal and the number of Keeps is low.
    This is indeed the case.
    In most Add/Keep/Drop triples, the Drop column has the highest
    value and the Keep column has the lowest value.
    The optimistic conclusion is that creators are fixing the code
    highlighted by errors.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%  STOP!  ROUGH TEXT BELOW     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item
    After the syntax errors, \code{CountMismatch},
    \code{TypeMismatch}, and \code{GenericError} are the most common
    \mnonstrict{} and \mstrict{} errors.
    \FILL{} so what.

  \item
    \FILL{} which errors break the Drop > Add > Keep ``preferred order''?

  \item
    (NOTE may want to save relative popularity for next section.)
    Some errors occur more often in \mnonstrict{} than \mstrict{}:
    \code{CannotCallNonFunction},
    \code{CannotExtendTable},
    \code{GenericExtraInformation},
    \code{FunctionDoesNotTakeSelf},
    \code{IllegalRequire},
    \code{ModuleHasCyclicDependency},
    \code{OptionalValueAccess},
    \code{UnknownPropButGotLikeProp}.
    \QALAN{} are any of these surprising, or expected from the bigger number of
    \mnonstrict{} records?

  \item
    A few errors are more common in \mstrict{} than \mnonstrict{}:
    \code{CannotInferBinaryOperation},
    \code{FunctionExitsWithoutReturn},
    \code{IncorrectGenericParamCount}.
    \FILL{} so what.

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Do Error Highlights Help?}

\FILL{} data seems to say yes.

\end{table}

\Cref{t:type-error-count} reports the percent of
type errors that overlap with the edit range.
This table is based on the same data as the previous table~(\cref{t:type-error-survival}),
but focuses on the overall popularity of type errors
rather than their relation to edits.
The left column in each row names one kind of type error
that overlaps with an edit range.
The right column shows what percentage of all overlapping
errors the current error took up.

There are two subtables, for \mnonstrict{} and \mstrict{} mode.
The table does not report \mnocheck{} because all its type errors are
by definition \code{SyntaxError}s.

\paragraph{Observations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    As we noted above, the most popular errors are syntax errors
    (\FILL{} \pct{0} \mnonstrict{}, \pct{0} \mstrict{})..
    This is undoubtedly due to the stochiastic nature
    of our telemetry, which has no way to avoid
    reporting edits that happen in the middle of things.
    For example, a creator who writes a method call
    \code{bucket.countFish()} letter-by-letter will
    get type analysis to find errors like \code{UnknownSymbol(buck)}
    and \code{UnknownProperty(bucket.c)}.
    These are transient issues, but telemetry may catch them.

  \item
    \code{TypeMismatch} is far more common in \mstrict{} (\pct{20.46})
    than \mnonstrict{} (\pct{2.44}) because \mstrict{} mode
    has additional type constraints.
    Several other errors have higher \mstrict{} percentages for the
    same reason, for example, \code{CannotInferBinaryOperation}.

  \item
    Two errors that appear in the \mstrict{} records
    never appear in \mnonstrict{}: \code{OccursCheckFailed} and \code{IncorrectGenericParamCount}.
    We attribute these to more advanced uses of types in \mstrict{} mode.

  \item
    Four errors from the \mnonstrict{} records never appeared in \mstrict{} mode:
    \code{DuplicateTypeDefinition}, \code{OnlyTablesCanHaveMethods},
    \code{MissingUnionProperty}, and \code{FunctionDoesNotTakeSelf}.
    (\QALAN{} is this interesting, or just a result of having less strict data?)

  \item
    \FILL{} which errors that NEVER showed up?
    Nothing for \code{CodeTooComplex} or \code{UnificationTooComplex} is great news.
    But what about the others?
    \code{DynamicPropertyLookupOnClassesUnsafe}?
    \code{SwappedGenericTypeParameter}?

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Internal Limits, Code Too Complex}
\label{s:code-too-complex}
%% data = out/ctc-info.txt

To deal with pathologies such as the worst-case time for ML-style type
inference~\cite{m-popl-1990,ktu-caap-1990}, the typechecker
has internal limits that restrict the problems it will attempt to solve.
Hitting a limit triggers one of the following errors:
\code{CodeTooComplex},
\code{NormalizationTooComplex}, or
\code{UnificationTooComplex}.
These errors can appear in Script Analysis just like any other
error, but one design goal of Luau is that code rarely hits the limits.
A typical creator should never see these errors.

Fortunately, the data rarely contains too-complex errors.
None of these errors appear in edit ranges~(\cref{t:type-error-count}).
For the specific case of \code{CodeTooComplex}, our telemetry tracked project-wide
counts and found only 26 of these errors, which were spread across eleven
records in three sessions.
It is entirely possible that all these errors came from one creator who
deliberately pushed the limits of type analysis.
Whatever the reason, the overall number is low enough to suggest that the
internal limits are not posing barriers to typechecker adoption.


\subsection{Type Error Density}

\begin{figure}[t]\centering

  \caption{Changes over time (seconds) to type error density (total errors / lines in project).}
  \label{f:error-density}
\end{figure}

\FILL{} what does the FS plot look like? is that a better nocheck-vs-rest comparison??

Moving on to type errors across the projects, and not just in the edit range,
a first interesting question is to study how the overall number of errors
changes over time.
But, the sheer number of errors can be skewed by codebase size.
To give a better basis for project-to-project comparisons, we focus
on the density of errors rather than the count, where \emph{density} is
the total number of type errors divided by the lines of code in the project.

\Cref{f:error-density} presents a zoomed-in view of type error density as it
changes over time in every session of the dataset.
The x-axis counts time in seconds from the start of the session.
The y-axis shows the change in density from the previous telemetry record
in the session to the next.
Changes can be positive or negative depending on whether the edits added
or removed errors.
The plots cut off at$\pm{}50$ density and 150 seconds.to focus on the
bulk of the data.
%% Sadly even with the zoom, it's too hard to follow one session ... the plot only gives a big-picture impression.


\paragraph{Observations}

Due to the relative adoption of type analysis, there is much more
data for the weak \mnocheck{} mode than for \mnonstrict{},
and in turn for \mnonstrict{} relative to \mstrict{}.
Still, the plots reveal interesting points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    All three plots are roughly balanced,
    with equal ``mass'' above and below the x-axis.
    The next section explores this point in detail.

  \item
    After the 40-second mark, changes to type error density become much
    smaller.
    Why?
    There are also fewer sessions (\mstrict{} makes that very clear).

  \item
    \mnonstrict{} has the biggest number of up/down deltas in the 10+ range.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Do Edits Tend to Add Type Errors?}

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  % TODO use bars instead, percent only, don't care about counts
  %% TODO old version had +-20% add/drop and a bigger % of keeps. What changed?
  \begin{tabular}{lr@{}rr@{}rr@{}r}
    & \zerowidth{Add} & & \zerowidth{Keep} & & \zerowidth{Drop} \\\midrule
    \mnocheck{} & 48378 & [\pct{46.83}] & 9440 & [\pct{9.14}] & 45479 & [\pct{44.03}] \\
    \mnonstrict{} & 19491 & [\pct{39.63}] & 9567 & [\pct{19.45}] & 20121 & [\pct{40.91}] \\
    \mstrict{} & 733 & [\pct{39.18}] & 368 & [\pct{19.67}] & 770 & [\pct{41.15}] \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{How often do edits increase, maintain, or decrease the number of type errors?}
  \label{f:error-changes}
\end{figure}

The apparent visual symmetry in the density plots~(\cref{f:error-density})
suggests that edits add and remove errors with rougly equal frequency,
regardless of mode.
No matter whether a creator is using \mnocheck{}, \mnonstrict{},
or \mstrict{} mode, edits seem to balance increases and decreases in the number
of type errors.
\Cref{f:error-changes} explores this question of balance in detail.
For each of the three modes, it reports the percent of edits that increase (Add),
maintain at a nonzero level (Keep), or decrease (Drop) the number of type
errors in the project.


\paragraph{Observations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Adds and Drops are remarkably balanced: across all three modes, they are
    at most \pct{2} apart from one another.
    This confirms that changes to the number of errors are balanced.
    Creators tend to fix errors highlighted by type analysis
    even in the stricter analysis modes.

  \item
    The percentage of Keeps is somewhat high: nearly \pct{10} in \mnocheck{}
    and \pct{20} in \mnonstrict{} and \mstrict{}.
    Evidently, the mode plays a role here.
    Outside of \mnocheck{}, type errors are more likely to persist through edits.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Two Activities: Asset Creation and Scripting}

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  %% TODO

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Comparing the change in type errors to the change in forced strict errors.}
  \label{f:tefs-compass}
\end{figure}

Since Roblox Studio runs each codebase through two passes of type analysis,
it is interesting to compare their results.
Of special interest is the \mstrict{} mode case, because the number of
type errors and forced strict errors should be nearly the same.
But, there are two differences between \mstrict{} type checking
and forced strict checking:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Forced strict checks all dependencies in \mstrict{} mode, no matter
    what mode they declare.
    So, the number of forced strict errors may be higher.
  \item
    Forced strict has looser rules for the \emph{data model};
    that is, for the static assets that a program manipulates.
    So, the number of forced strict errors may be lower.
    %% initial DM, all properties go into a table type; DM -> folder -> model -> part
    %% get dot-driven autocomplete
\end{itemize}
Our data contains a surprising number of records where forced strict
reports fewer errors.
Data model edits are apparently a regular occurrence in Luau programs.

\Cref{f:tefs-compass} compares changes in type errors (\tekey{}) to changes in forced
strict errors (\fskey{}) for the three analysis modes.
To a first approximation, the changes either agree with one another
or disagree.
For example, if type errors increase but forced strict errors decrease,
we have a disagreement.
The plots futher categorize agreements and disagreements into
the following five cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \emph{zero}: neither \tekey{} nor \fskey{} changed
  \item
    \emph{te only}: \tekey{} changed but \fskey{} remained the same
  \item 
    \emph{fs only}: \tekey{} remained the same but \fskey{} changed
  \item
    \emph{dis}: \tekey{} and \fskey{} changed in opposite directions
  \item 
    \emph{agree}: \tekey{} and \fskey{} changed in the same direction
\end{enumerate}
Both \emph{zero} and \emph{agree} are agreements.
The others are disagreements.
The plots show what percent of all telemetry records fell into these five categories.

\paragraph{Observations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    All three plots have a nonzero percentage of \emph{te only} items.
    In \mstrict{} mode, the percentage jumps up to nearly \pct{25}.
    Since \fskey{} is more lenient only for data model changes, these must
    be edits that affect the model in a way that raises a type error.
    Naturally, \mstrict{} mode has the largest number of such edits because
    its type checker is the most careful.

  \item
    In the first plot, for \mnocheck{},
    half the records are \emph{zero\/}s, nearly half are \emph{fs only}, and only a few
    land in the other categories.
    While the number of zeros is a bit high,
    the \emph{fs. only} spike makes sense because type checking is supposed to complain
    sparingly in \mnocheck{} mode.

  \item
    In the \mnonstrict{} plot, the number of agreements jumps up.
    This is reassuring.
    \FILL{}.

\end{itemize}

Users of \mstrict{} mode may find it frustrating that the type checker complains
about data model edits.
Though we cannot see the exact reason for the complaints, the checker errs on
the conservative side.
Thus we expect the number of useful reports is low.
This may be a barrier to adaption.


\subsection{Session Timelines}

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  %% TODO any way to cluster timelines to avoid the "creepiness" of spying on one user?
%  \mnonstrict{}\\
%  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{img/timeline-nonstrict.pdf}

  \medskip{}
  \mstrict{}\\
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{img/timeline-strict.pdf}

  \caption{Two example sessions.}
  \label{f:indy-session}
\end{figure}

Another insightful visualization that the telemetry supports is plots of individual sessions
over time.
\Cref{f:indy-session} shows the type errors, forced strict errors, and module switches
in two \mstrict{} mode sessions.
The x-axis shows time in seconds from the start of the session.
The y-axis counts errors.
Type errors appear as orange plus marks.
Forced strict errors appear as green x marks.
The vertical lines show module switches.

In the first plot, the error counts are low until about the 3,000s mark,
at which point an edit (not a module switch) leads to 15 errors.
These 15 errors disappear two records later.
Then, after two module switches and some edits, the number of errors spikes again.
In the second plot, the number of errors spikes in the beginning due to edits,
then remains low for the next few thousand seconds.

A general observation is that the number of type errors is always less than the number of forced strict
errors, though the numbers are close.
This should happen in \mstrict{} mode.

\begin{verbatim}
 require(foobar)
  foobar is a module script in the data model
 require(foo.bar.b)
  - could be edit in progress
  - could be renamed module
  - 
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{s:threats}

Error counts per-project and per-module include syntax errors.
Problematic, because syntax errors are uninteresting (easy to fix),
but common, which makes it likely that our per-keystroke telemetry (1/200) will record them.
Edit range has specific counts.
Next time, we should do that for the other aggregates.

We are sampling sessions. Could miss interesting ones.

Sampling by keystroke means different things for different creators.
Depends how they type.
Scripted interactions that generate a large number of keystrokes per second
can swamp our data and are hard to distinguish from genuine interactions.
Copy paste might just look like a bot.
\QALAN{} I think you said a paste counts as 1 keystroke; is that right?

We have no knowledge whatsoever about interesting events like save run publish.
Publish events are private.

Changes to errors in the edit range are hard to follow.
Could add one error but remove another of the same kind,
then we can't distinguish from ignoring the error.

Edit ranges are coarse, merely the top and bottom edit.
No idea what happened in between.
Long time between keystroke events makes this even worse.

Telemetry cannot replace user studies, as there is no way to measure
creator sentiment, but provide complementary data at scale.
No idea about intent is a big problem, we don't know which error the creator wanted to fix.

Type analysis reports many errors at once.
No way to know what the creator is looking at.
Not even sure they have the analysis widget open.

Internal validity?

External validity?

Construct validity?

Conclusion validity

Ecological validity is high.

% kindle track every tap (page turn etc),

% opt-out possible~\cite{kindle-telemetry}

Type error telemetry in Roblox Studio has two distinguishing characteristics:
it includes no personal information (PII), and it sends data on
randomly-selected runs of the type checker rather than specific events of interest.
To the best of our knowledge, this design occupies a unique position relative to prior
work~(\cref{t:telemetry-design}).

In other professional-grade IDEs, such as VSCode~\cite{vscode-telemetry}
and \code{.NET}~\cite{dotnet-telemetry}, telemetry may include all sorts of
data: error reports, source code fragments, timestamps, and filepaths.
Users may be able to opt out of some telemetry, but the details depend on the
license agreement.
Furthermore, at least in VSCode, IDE extensions can report their own telemetry.
While this data can be invaluable for discovering bugs in production, it
must be handled with extreme care.

The Blackbox project similarly collects telemetry in broad strokes.
Every Java program submitted for compilation goes into the Blackbox database (minus
any comments above the main class) along with the compiler's response~\cite{bkmu-sigcse-2014}.
%% Though somewhat intrusive,
The millions of programs in the Blackbox dataset
have enabled dozens of contributions to the area of CS
education~\cite{bask-icer-2018}, ranging from categorization of novice
errors~\cite{mk-fie-2014,m-masters-2016} to analyses of error frequency and
time-to-fix~\cite{ab-sigcse-2015}.

At the opposite end of the privacy spectrum, Go's design for \emph{transparent
telemetry} reports only counter values~\cite{transparent-telemetry}.
Unlike Roblox Studio, transparent telemetry includes no timestamps and no 
session ids.
The data is useful for learning about the frequency of specific events and the
distribution of events across clients (e.g., how many \code{CodeTooComplex}
errors arise? what is the average number of type errors?).
However, the lack of timestamps and ids means that it cannot track edits
over time (a feature that is quite useful to us, for example, in~\cref{f:error-density}).
% In~\cref{f:error-density}, for example, we see that increases to the number
% of type errors are quickly followed by decreases.
% Without timestamps, we would be unable to rule out the possibility that users
% build up a mountain of type errors and then slowly reduce them to zero.


\paragraph{Telemetry Enhancements: What and How to Sample}

One way to futher strengthen the privacy of any telemetry design, including
transparent telemetry, is to systematically add noise to the data using
techniques from differential
privacy~\cite{zhlbr-cc-2020,epk-ccs-2014,wblj-usenix-2017}.
Recent work that is especially relevant to the session-based data collected
by Roblox Studio shows how to add noise to traces~\cite{zhlbr-cc-2020},
how to account for known relationships between events~\cite{zhlbr-oopsla-2020},
and how to choose the noise amount on the client side~\cite{hlzbr-ecoop-2021}.
Applying differential privacy is subtle, however.
While we can likely fuzz the total number of type errors, if we were to
fuzz the number of \code{CodeTooComplex} errors, it might drastically
affect our conclusions.

Cooperative bug isolation is a method for designing
telemetry systems~\cite{liblit-thesis}.
The focus is not on privacy, but rather on how to collect a small amount of
data from each user and perform statistically-sound analyses.
Each feature of interest \emph{within} a user's codebase has a uniform-random
probability of contributing telemetry.
The system-builder can analyze this telemetry with predicates to identify
notable events and logistic regression to narrow down nondeterministic bugs.
There is a high burden on designers to decide what to capture,
but a careful design can minimize the data from each individual user.

%% ... privacy is future work, can maybe avoid private data with a type system

Two further refinements, which reduce the burden on experts to
select points of interest, are adaptive bug isolation~\cite{nl-icse-2010}
and blame-proportional logging~\cite{lnsmc-usenix-2018}.
Adaptive bug isolation starts with a set of predicates, studies which are
most correlated with failures, and experiments with adding telemetry to nearby
predicates; this technique can reduce the overhead of telemetry by two orders
of magnitude relative to naive binary instrumentation.
Blame-proportional logging starts with lightweight telemetry to recognize
defects, assigns ranks to methods estimating their likelihood as root causes,
and uses the ranks and future observations to narrow down the cause.
Deep transfer learning is another promising way to hone in on events of
interest~\cite{zfstt-ieeesensors-2022}.

\paragraph{User Studies, Errors, and Type Errors}

Our approach to data analysis is inspired by Marceau
et~al.~\cite{mfk-onward-2011,mfk-sigcse-2011}, who used keystroke-level data
collected over 6 weeks to analyze students' responses to runtime errors
in DrRacket~\cite{fcffksf-jfp-2002}.
Similarly, Macedo et~al.~\cite{mcpcsprs-abz-2020,mcpcsprs-scp-2021} capture
edit sessions from the online Alloy4Fun editor and present several automated
analyses.
A major challenge in our setting, however, is that edit sequences are
incomplete---there may be minutes-long gaps between two telemetry records.
Several more-recent works have studied edit sequences
to draw conclusions about errors and intent, e.g.,~\cite{wk-koli-2020,lgk-pj-2022,rsgl-cpp-2020}.

The BitFit project collects data about beginning students interactions with a
Java IDE~\cite{ekc-wccce-2016,anna-russo-kennedy-ms-2006}; however, unlike Blackbox, it does
not collect source code.
BitFit data consists of a timestamp, a session id, and counter values showing
the number of attempts at a question, the number of hints requested, the number
of compiles and runs, and the number of submission attempts.
On one hand, this data is more informative than Roblox Studio's because it
targets specific events rather than random keystrokes.
On the other hand, there are no details about errors to show what students
struggled with.
Other logging-based studies of Java programs use the full error message to
draw conclusions~\cite{bgimgm-cse-2016,dlc-iticse-2014}.
Roblox Studio cannot follow this approach because strings in errors may leak
personal information.

Much work on the benefits of static types focuses on a small number
of case studies~\cite{w-popl-1986,hw-scp-2004,td-tosem-2001},
inverviews~\cite{cdhhjklwya-hatra-2020,gstf-hatra-2021,cams-oopsla-2020},
or static corpuses~\cite{rppd-fse-2014,bhmvv-toplas-2019,bmvv-arxiv-2019}
(for literature reviews, see~\cite{empirical-types,heeren-thesis}).
Controlled experiments, for example comparing statically-typed Java and dynamically-typed
Groovy~\cite{khrts-icpc-2012}, are a notable exception.
Lerner et~al.~\cite{lfgc-pldi-2007} apply type error repair tool on over two thousand
of programs written during five homework exercises.
Seidel et~al.~\cite{sscwj-oopsla-2017,sjw-jfp-2018} use five thousand programs
to train data-driven methods for localizing errors.
These large studies with several thousands of programs are
nevertheless on a much smaller scale than Roblox Studio.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}

Quickly summarize findings:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \pct{50} of errors in current module, so probably errors appear locally (not in a distant module);
    \pct{5} of (current? old??) type errors overlap with edit range, so they don't stick around.
  \item
    \pct{90} \mnocheck{},  \pct{10} \mnonstrict{},  \pct{0.1} \mstrict{}, wow.
  \item
  \item
  \item
    DM awareness is an important and surprising gap between strict
    and forced strict, undoubtedly a usability barrier for \mstrict{}.
  \item
\end{itemize}

Quick regrets, lessons learned, advice for next time

\paragraph{Future work: Low adaption}

why so few using nonstrict and strict?
needs advertising?
needs usability?


\paragraph{Do we need timestamps?}

FILL these were helpful for the overview

Our telemetry records include timestamps.
While timestamps are not personal data per se, they are in the ballpark.
Telemetry would be even more private without them.
Do we need them?

Timestamps are not the focus of our analysis, but they do play a critical role.
Consider~\cref{f:error-density}.
With timestamps, it is clear that error density stays close to zero.
Without timestamps, we would be left with the counts at the bottom
of~\cref{f:error-density}.
Many distributions could fit those counts, such as a ``mountain'' session that first
grows and grows the number of type errors then shrinks and shrinks down to zero.
